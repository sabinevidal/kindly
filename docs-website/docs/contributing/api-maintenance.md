# ðŸ›  API contributions
Keep an eye on our [Github Repo](https://github.com/unicef/kindly) for any issues which come up that you think you'll be able to help with. Remember to comment so we can assign the issue to you!

Check out the [development docs](../technical/development) to see how to set up a development environment so you can work on the Kindly repo.
Our backend is set up as an API, so you can also make calls to this on Postman or with `curl`. We also have a [website](https://kindly.unicef.io) where you can check phrases with the Kindly API, alternatively once you've set up the development environment you can use the [web client](../overview#web-client).
